    <h1 style={{color: '#ffffff'}}>Purpose</h1>
    <p style={{color: '#ffffff'}}>The primary purpose of this UI kit is to streamline the process of building websites and applications, making it both time-efficient and customizable.

  <section>
    <h1 style={{color: '#ffffff'}}>Create a React app</h1>
    <p style={{color: '#ffffff'}}>To kickstart your new project with the Kit, we do recommend to generate a boilerplate React app with the official create-react-app tool: you will be provided with a solid build setup with zero effort (that is, no configuration needed on your part). An example using the UI-Kit and create-react-app can be found here.</p>
    <p style={{color: '#ffffff'}}>You can use the Codesandbox template template to try out the Kit without installing anything.</p>

    <p style={{color: '#ffffff'}}>An example implementation using create-react-app and scss can be found in our GitHub repository.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h1 style={{color: '#ffffff'}}>Add the Kit as a dependency</h1>
    <p style={{color: '#ffffff'}}>The next step is to add the Kit to your project as a dependency. You can choose to install it through npm or yarn: they are both valid package managers and we don't want to recommend one over the other, but once you pick your favourite tool, simply stick with it and avoid using them simultaneously.</p>
    <p style={{color: '#ffffff'}}>To install the Kit through npm, run:</p>
    ```bash
    npm install @aj-codes2020/ui-kit
    ```
  </section>

  <section>
    <h1 style={{color: '#ffffff'}}>Using the Kit</h1>
    <p style={{color: '#ffffff'}}>Once installed, you can start using the components in your project. Here is an example of how to use the `Button` component:</p>
    <span style={{color: '#ffffff'}}>
    ```jsx
      import { Button } from '@aj-codes2020/ui-kit';

    <Button variant="primary">Click Me</Button>
    ```
    </span>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h1 style={{color: '#ffffff'}}>Example Project</h1>
    <p style={{color: '#ffffff'}}>Our components are designed to be easily customizable. You can use props to adjust their appearance and behavior to suit your needs. </p>
    <p style={{color: '#ffffff'}}>To see the UI kit in action, check out our example project on [GitHub](https://github.com/aj-codes2020). This project demonstrates how to use each component and provides best practices for integration.</p>
