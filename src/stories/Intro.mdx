# Welcome to the UI Kit

Welcome to the AJ.Codes UI Kit! This comprehensive set of components is designed to help you build beautiful and functional interfaces with ease. Whether you are creating a personal project, a professional website, or a complex web application, our UI kit provides you with the tools you need to get the job done efficiently and effectively.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this UI kit is to streamline the process of building websites and applications, making it both time-efficient and customizable. By leveraging these components, you can focus on the unique aspects of your project while still ensuring a high level of quality and consistency across your interface.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can install the UI kit package via npm:

```bash
npm install @aj-codes2020/ui-kit
```

Once installed, you can start using the components in your project. Here is an example of how to use the `Button` component:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@aj-codes2020/ui-kit';

const MyComponent = () => (
  <Button variant="primary">Click Me</Button>
);
```

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to your project directory.
3. Run the installation command above.

## Usage

### Importing Components

Each component can be imported individually to keep your bundle size small. For example, to use the `Grid` component:

```tsx
import { Grid } from '@aj-codes2020/ui-kit';
```

### Customization

Our components are designed to be easily customizable. You can use props to adjust their appearance and behavior to suit your needs. For instance, the `Button` component comes with several variants such as `primary`, `secondary`, and `tertiary`.
