# File Upload

The File Upload component allows you to upload files, with support for multiple files and custom class names.

<Canvas of={FileUploadStories.Default} />

## Usage

To use the File Upload component, import it and handle the file selection via the `onFileSelect` prop.

```tsx
import { FileUpload } from 'path-to-your-components';

const handleFileSelect = (file: File | null) => {
  console.log(file);
};

<FileUpload onFileSelect={handleFileSelect} />;
```

You can customize the Button component using CSS. The following class names are available for customization:

`file-upload`: The main container for the file upload component.\
`file-input`: The input element for file selection.\
`file-info`: The container for displaying selected file information.\
`file-info p`: The paragraph displaying the file names.\
`file-info button`: The button to remove selected files.
