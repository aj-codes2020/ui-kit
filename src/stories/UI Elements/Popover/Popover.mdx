# Popover

The Popover component allows you to display additional content when users click or hover over an element. It's useful for providing more information or options without cluttering the UI.

<Canvas of={PopoverStories.Default} />

## Usage

To use the Popover component, import it and pass the content to be displayed in the popover along with the element that triggers it.

```tsx
import { Popover } from 'path-to-your-components';

const App = () => (
  <Popover content="This is a popover" position="bottom">
    <button>Click me</button>
  </Popover>
);
```
